Development of a Tic-Tac-Toe game (JavaScript Basics)

Goal of the project:

Develop an interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game with JavaScript. Your goal is to create a fully functional game that supports both "Player vs. Player" and "Player vs. Computer" modes. Use your knowledge of JavaScript, HTML and CSS to design an attractive and intuitive user interface.

JavaScript Fundamentals

•	Variables and Data Types: Understand how to use variables, arrays, objects and data types.
•	Functions: Learn how to declare and use functions, including both regular and arrow functions.
•	Control Structures: Gain experience with conditional statements (if, else) and loops.

Data Management

•	State Management: Managing and maintaining the state of the application, such as keeping track of states in an array.
•	Local Storage: Learning how to use the browser’s local storage API to save game states so that they persist even after refreshing the page.

DOM Manipulation

•	Selecting Elements: Learn how to access and manipulate HTML elements using document.getElementById, querySelector, etc.
•	Event Handling: Implement event listeners to respond to user interactions, such as clicks.
•	Updating the UI: Learn how to dynamically update the web page by modifying the DOM.

Game Logic and Algorithms

•	Game State Management: Develop skills in managing the game state, including the current player, board status and winning conditions.
•	Logic Implementation: Create algorithms to check for win conditions, such as checking rows, columns and diagonals.
•	Input Validation: Ensure that user inputs are valid (e.g., not allowing a player to overwrite an already filled square).

User Experience (UX) Considerations

•	UI: Implement visual indicators for player turns, winning conditions and other game states.
•	Game Resetting: Create functionality to reset the game and start a new game, improving user experience.

Basic CSS for Styling

•	Learn how to style the game board and its elements using CSS, making the app visually appealing and user-friendly.

Debugging and Testing

•	Develop debugging skills by troubleshooting issues that arise during coding.
•	Learn about testing the application to ensure that logic holds under various scenarios.

Version Control

•	Git & GitHub: Practicing version control and collaborating on projects using platforms like GitHub.

Project Management

•	Gain experience in planning, designing, and implementing a project from start to finish including iterations and improvements based on testing.

Requirements

1.	Player vs. Player Module (Difficulty: Easy)

•	Implement the logic for a game where two players can take turns making moves.
•	Make sure the game recognizes when a player has won or when the game ends in a draw.
•	Display the winner or a tie on the screen.

2.	Player vs. Computer Mode (Difficulty: Medium)

•	Implement a "computer" opponent that can compete against the player. The computer should initially play "stupidly", i.e. it randomly chooses a free position on the playing field.

3.	Point system (difficulty: medium)

•	Introduce a scoring system that counts the number of wins, losses and draws for both game modes.
•	Save the scores so that they are available even after restarting the game (e.g. with Local Storage).

4.	User Interface (Difficulty: Medium)

•	Create an attractive board layout that visually clearly indicates whose turn it is.
•	 Add buttons to switch between game modes and reset the game.
•	Make sure the design is responsive so that the game works well on different devices.

5.	Algorithm for the Computer (Difficulty: Hard)

•	Implement an algorithm (e.g. Minimax) that lets the computer play strategically. This can be added as an extension after the base implementation of the "dumb" computer.

6.	Animations and Effects (Difficulty: Medium - Hard)

•	Add animations that visually support the placement of X’s and O’s.
•	Implement sound effects for actions like making a mark, winning, or a draw.

7.	Difficulty level (Difficulty: Medium - Hard)

•	Implement different difficulty levels for Player vs. Computer mode (easy, medium, hard).

8.	Design and Usability (Difficulty: Easy - Medium)

•	Make sure the game is user-friendly and intuitive to use.
•	Add help text or a short tutorial that explains the rules to new players.

GitHub exercise

•	Upload the code to a GitHub repository and ensure that all files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) are well structured and commented. 
•	Create a README file that contains a short description of the project, instructions on how to use it, and information about the implemented features.
